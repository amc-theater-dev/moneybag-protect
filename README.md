# moneybag-protect

this mod extends the amount of time that your tax return moneybag is invincible after being dispensed

in the base game it's invincible for 3 seconds - but this isn't enough to stop the bag from 'splodin after a long fall. there's also a colored glow added, similar to how enemy souls glow when protected

invincibility length and the color of the glow are adjustable via the config file (`\REPO\BepInEx\config\mod.moneybagprotect.cfg`)

*inspired by an actual case of the tax return bag bouncing off the cart and falling into lava*
