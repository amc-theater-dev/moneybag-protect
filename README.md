# moneybag-protect

this mod extends the amount of time that your tax return moneybag is invincible after being dispensed

by default it's invincible for 3 seconds - but this isn't enough to stop the bag from 'splodin after a long fall

# todo

- maybe eventually make the glow color user-adjustable idk
- maybe eventually make the invincibility timer user-adjustable idk
