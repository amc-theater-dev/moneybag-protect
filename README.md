# moneybag-protect
this mod protects your fat tax return from dropping off a cliff, or into a boiling vat of nickelodeon slime

by default it's invincible for 3 seconds anyways - but this isn't enough to stop the bag from 'splodin after a long fall

# todo
maybe eventually make the invincibility timer user-adjustable idk
